/**
 * Create a game using the Abstract Factory pattern.
 * The game should have a set of characters, including warriors, mages, and archers.
 * The characters should belong to either the human or elf race.
 * The Abstract Factory should provide an interface for creating these characters, and concrete factories should be implemented for each race.
 * The client should be able to switch between the different concrete factories to create different sets of characters.
 * Finally, the game should be able to print out the stats of each character, including their name, health, level, and abilities.
